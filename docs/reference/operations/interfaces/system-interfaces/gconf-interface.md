# gconf-interface

The `gconf`  interface  allows access to any item from the legacy [GConf configuration system](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gconf) for the current user, typically used by old GNOME desktop libraries and applications. 

This interface needs to be manually connected because _gconf_ is a global database for GNOME desktop and application settings and offers no application isolation.

See [Interface management](/) and [Supported interfaces](/interfaces/index) for further details on how interfaces are used.

**Auto-connect**: no

Modern applications should use dconf/gsettings instead and this interface is provided for old codebases that cannot be migrated.
