Deepen your understanding of how snaps can run on all kinds of devices, in all kinds of environments.

* [System options](/reference/administration/system-options): Configurations options for the system and native snap devices.
* [Data locations]():
* [Distribution support](/reference/administration/distribution-support): The status of current builds for Linux distributions with snap support.
* [Network requirements](/reference/administration/network-requirements): What network access snaps require to operate correctly.
* [Timer string format](process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks): The string format to use whenever times, dates and durations are defined.

## Requesting permission

Snaps that require privileged access to resources need to go through a review step.

* [Process for aliases, auto-connections and tracks](process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks): How to ask for permission reviews on your snaps.
* [Public, private and unlisted-snaps](public-private-unlisted-snaps): The difference between the snaps everyone can see, and those limited to specific users.
* [Reviewing classic confinement snaps](reviewing-classic-confinement-snaps): How classic confinement permissions are granted.
