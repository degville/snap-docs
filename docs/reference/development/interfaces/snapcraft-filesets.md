# snapcraft-filesets

A *fileset* is used within [snapcraft.yaml](/) to represent a group of files, or a single file, when [creating a snap](/).


```{caution}
Filesets are not supported when building on `core22` or newer bases.  See the `core20`->`core22` [migration guide](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/micro-howto-migrate-from-core20-to-core22/30188#heading--filesets) for details.
```

They're useful when moving files into the *stage* and *prime* areas of the build process (see [Snapcraft lifecycle](/) for more details) as they can be referenced individually, rather than always having to construct a list of filenames. 

A fileset is implemented as a YAML map between the fileset name (the key) and a list of corresponding filenames for each fileset. This list can be built from any of the following:

- individual files, eg. `[ bin/dnsmasq ]`
- subdirectory paths, eg. `[ etc ]`
- wildcard globs, eg. `[ usr/* ]`
- globstar globs, eg. `[ lib/**/*.so* ]`

The `*` (asterisk) wildcard glob returns all the files in that path. Conversely, adding an initial `-` (dash) will exclude the files in that path. For example, you could add `usr/local/*` then remove `usr/local/man/*` with the following:

```yaml
filesets:
   allbutman: [ usr/local/*, -usr/local/man/* ]
```
Filenames are relative to the part install directory, eg. `parts/<part-name>/install`. 

If you have used the [organize](/) keyword to rename files from your snapcraft.yaml part, your fileset will be built from filenames *after*  they're renamed.

## Conflicting rules example

Snapcraft *will* attempt to aggregate conflicting rules from different filesets. For example, take the following directory and file structure: 

```bash
adir
├── adirthat
├── adirthis
└── bdir
    ├── bdirthat
    └── bdirthis
```

The following fileset definition will not stage `adir/bdir/*` despite its specific inclusion under `adir/*`:

```yaml
filesets:
  exclude-dir: [ -adir/bdir/* ]
  include-dir: [ adir/* ]
stage:
  - $include-dir
  - $exclude-dir
```

In the above example, using the excluding syntax `adir/bdir` instead of  `adir/bdir/*` would exclude both the `bdir` directory **and** its contents, rather than excluding only the contents, retaining the empty `bdir` itself.

This is how the above will be staged within the snap:

```
adir
├── adirthat
├── adirthis
└── bdir
```

If, however, we remove the `exclude-dir: [ -adir/bdir/* ]` fileset definition, all the files and directories beneath _adir_ will be staged in the snap:

```
adir
├── adirthat
├── adirthis
└── bdir
    ├── bdirthat
    └── bdirthis
```
