## New Features

### ROS 1 Extension

The new ROS 1 [extension](/) allows you to target `core20` with ROS 1 _Noetic Ninjemys_, the latest (and last) ROS 1 LTS that runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).

You can now build a ROS 1 application with a  `snapcraft.yaml`  as simple as:

```yaml
name: catkin-noetic-hello
version: "1.0"
summary: hello world
description: |
  A ROS 1 roscpp-based workspace.
grade: stable
confinement: strict
base: core20

apps:
  catkin-noetic-hello:
    command: opt/ros/noetic/lib/snapcraft_hello/snapcraft_hello
    plugs: [network, network-bind]
    extensions: [ros1-noetic]

parts:
  hello:
    plugin: catkin
    source: .
    build-packages: [g++, make]
```

It's operation and functionality is similar to the newly introduced [ROS 2 extension](/), and the associated colcon plugin, added in [Snapcraft 4.2](/interfaces/release-notes-snapcraft-4-2).

### Set the default Channel Track

It is now possible to set a [default track](/) for your snap: 

```bash
$ snapcraft set-default-track <snap-name> 17
Default track for '<snap-name>' set to '17'
```

This features complements the ability to list channel tracks, which as added in [Snapcraft 4.2](/interfaces/release-notes-snapcraft-4-2).
