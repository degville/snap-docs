# release-notes-snapcraft-4-6

Snapcraft 4.6 is a feature-packed release, including:
- new extensions
-  _core20_ support for additional extensions and plugins
- a new login mechanism.
- plenty of bug fixes and smaller updates

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-release-notes) for other *Snapcraft* releases.

## Login mechanism

A new option, `--experimental-login` can now be used when using `snapcraft login` or `snapcraft export-login` and when signing assertions (see [Create a developer account](/interfaces/creating-your-developer-account)).

Using this option will trigger a web based authentication flow. To go back to the previous login method you must first `snapcraft logout`.

## Conda plugin

The [conda](/) plugin has been ported to [core20](/interfaces/base-snaps). These are the available plugin options:

* **`conda-packages`** (list of strings)
List of *conda* packages to install.
* **`conda-python-version`** (string)
The Python version to use for the *conda* packages.
 Python version major and minor version (e.g. 3.8).
* **`conda-miniconda-version`** (string)
The version of [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to bootstrap.
Defaults to the latest release.


## Package Repositories

The road to making this feature stable is closer, although a breaking change lands with 4.6 for this experimental feature. Keys are now using the suffix and not prefix of the key id.

See [Package repositories](/interfaces/package-repositories) for further details.

## Metadata

Snapcraft is now aware of the existence of `kernel.yaml` for snaps of type `kernel`.

The `install-mode` option for applications is now supported with this release.

## Extensions


### Gnome 3.38

The [gnome-3-38 extension](/interfaces/gnome-3-38-extension) is now considered stable.

### KDE Neon


The [KDE Neon extension](/interfaces/kde-neon-extension) now supports `core20` as an experimental extension.

### Flutter


New variants of the [Flutter extension](/) are now available for _stable_ and _beta_. The same documentation applies as for the master and dev variant.
