## Build providers

-   Disable automatic snap refreshes inside instances
-   LXD instances launch from a cached base instance rather than a base image. This reduces disk usage and launch time.
-   For the LXD launch function launched_environment, the parameter use_snapshots has been replaced by use_base_instance. use_snapshots still works but logs a deprecation notice.
-   Expire and recreate base instances older than 3 months (90 days)
-   Check for network connectivity after network-related commands fails
-   Set LXD id maps after launching or copying an instance
-   Raise BaseConfigurationError for snap refresh failures
-   Check LXD id map before starting an existing instance. If the id map does not match, the instance will be auto cleaned or an error will be raised.
