# release-notes-snapcraft-3-3

These are the release notes for [Snapcraft 3.3](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.3).

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](/), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](/) for other *Snapcraft* releases.

## New *core* features

### base: core

Support for `base: core` has been added.

This enables you to take advantage of the many new Snapcraft 3 features while using 16.04 as a [base](/t/snapcraft-overview/8940#base-snap). Previously, you needed to use the 18.04 base.

### Alternate directory for *snapcraft.yaml*

`build-aux/snap` is now supported as an alternative directory for *snapcraft.yaml* and its assets (i.e.; hooks, gui, ...).

To avoid confusion, snapcraft now display what directory it is picking for assets, depending on where the *snapcraft.yaml* is found. It will only pick `build-aux/snap` for assets if the `snapcraft.yaml` is found in that path.

### String validation

Snapcraft now produces a better error when the type detected for the version *string* is not a *string*.

## Plugins

### python

A minor fix to bring *rebuilding* capabilities to projects using the python plugin.

This means the days of seeing messages like the following should be long gone:

```bash
You must give at least one requirement to install (maybe you meant "pip install ...")

```

### python and go

Expanded schema errors for users of the Go and Python, allowing for early discovery of non-valid uses of these plugins. Most importantly, this eliminates the cryptic error during build time when not using a combination of the `source` and `<plugin-name>-packages` keywords.

### nodejs

Entries of type *string* are now supported in `package.json` for the `bin` keyword (previously, the plugin could only parse dictionary entries), this means that constructs from `package.json`, such as the following, will be parsed and interpreted correctly by Snapcraft:

```json
{
  "name": "unnamed",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Using string bin entries.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "bin": "bin/index.js",
}
```

## Store

### Register against a specific store

Brand stores are a commercial feature of the Snap Store, and it's now possible to register your snap with one of these stores.

The following syntax is now allowed as part of the `register` command:

```bash
$ snapcraft register [--store <store>] <snap-name>
```
