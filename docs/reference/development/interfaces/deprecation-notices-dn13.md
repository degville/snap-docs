(DRAFT)

Support will be removed for legacy and core-based projects in Snapcraft 5.0 (expected July 22, 2021).

To continue using the core base, Snapcraft has opened a legacy `4.x` track that maintains compatibility going forward. You may switch to this track using:
 `snap refresh snapcraft --channel=4.x/stable`

We highly recommend migrating your snap to core20.  For more information on migrating to core20, check out:
