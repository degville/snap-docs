A hook is an executable file that runs within a snap’s confined environment when a specific action occurs.

The filename of the executable is based on the name of the hook. If this file exists,  *snapd*  will execute the file when required by that hook’s action. See [Supported snap hooks](/) for more details on which hooks are supported.

[Snapcraft](/) can integrate hooks into a snap using two methods:

### 1. Using a project-wide `snap/hooks` directory

The hook executable can be placed in a directory called `snap/hooks` relative to where the `snapcraft` command is executed. This will typically mean creating a _hooks_ directory in the same directory that contains the _snapcraft.yaml_ file for your project. The following, for example, shows the location of a configure hook executable:

```
.
└── snap
    ├── hooks
    │   └── configure
    └── snapcraft.yaml
```

Hook executables in `snap/hooks` are automatically copied into the snap during Snapcraft's `prime` step (see [Parts lifecycle](/) for details).

### 2. From within snapcraft.yaml

A part within [snapcraft.yaml](/) can also generate and install hook executables into `$SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL/snap/hooks/`. These are automatically copied into the snap during the `prime` step.
    
```yaml
configure-hook:
    plugin: dump
    source: configure-again/
    organize:
        configure: snap/hooks/configure
```

## Plugs

By default, hooks run with no plugs. If a hook needs more privileges, it can use the top-level `hooks` attribute in `snapcraft.yaml` to request plugs:


```yaml
hooks: # Top-level YAML attribute, parallel to `apps`
  configure: # Hook name, corresponds to executable name
    plugs: [network] # Or any other plugs required by this hook
```

Hooks are called with no parameters. See [Using the snapctl tool](/) for details on the internal command they can use to provide and retrieve data to and from snapd.
