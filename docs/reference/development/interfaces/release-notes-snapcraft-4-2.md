## New Features

### ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy extension and updated colcon plugin

Snapcraft 4.2 includes experimental support for Robot Operating System  (ROS 2) [Foxy Fitzroy LTS](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Releases/Release-Foxy-Fitzroy)  with a new [extension](/) and colcon plugin when used with [`core20`](/interfaces/base-snaps).

For example, ROS 2 applications can now be built with a  `snapcraft.yaml` as simple as:

```yaml
name: ros2-talker-listener
version: '0.1'
summary: ROS2 Talker/Listener Example
description: |
  This example launches a ROS2 talker and listener.

grade: devel
confinement: strict
base: core20

parts:
  ros-demos:
    plugin: colcon
    source: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git
    source-branch: foxy
    source-subdir: demo_nodes_cpp
    build-packages: [make, gcc, g++]
    stage-packages: [ros-foxy-ros2launch]

apps:
  ros2-talker-listener:
    command: opt/ros/foxy/bin/ros2 launch demo_nodes_cpp talker_listener.launch.py
    plugs: [network, network-bind]
    extensions: [ros2-foxy]
```

For a walkthrough on how to work with the plugin and extension, see [https://snapcraft.io/blog/how-to-build-a-snap-using-ros-2-foxy](https://snapcraft.io/blog/how-to-build-a-snap-using-ros-2-foxy).

### Ninja file generation with cmake

By default, the [cmake plugin](t/the-cmake-plugin/8621) creates a Makefile when used with with  [`core20`](/interfaces/base-snaps) . This release adds the `cmake-generator` plugin property to optionally generate of a Ninja file:

```yaml
hello:
    source: .
    plugin: cmake
    cmake-parameters:
      - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    cmake-generator: Ninja
```
### List channel tracks from Snapcraft

You can now view the available [channel tracks](/) for a given snap with the new `snapcraft list-tracks <snap-name>` command (or with its alias, _tracks_).

The command output shows a list of tracks together with their status, creation date, and assigned version pattern, which is required by a given snap revision to be able to release to a given track:


```bash
Name    Status    Creation-Date    Version-Pattern
latest  default   -                -
```

_Status_ can be one of the following:
* default (implicit active)
* active
* hidden
* closed
