# release-notes-snapcraft-4-4

The team behind Snapcraft is pleased to announce the release of [Snapcraft 4.4](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/4.4).

Highlights for this release include:

* improved font generation performance when [desktop extensions](/)
* updates to package repository definitions and behaviour
* metrics for [Progressive Releases](/)
* many small but significant bug fixes

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcraft-overview/8940), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcraft-release-notes/10721) for other  *Snapcraft*  releases.

## New Features

### Command Line

Custom CA certificates can now be added to the build environments created by Snapcraft by using  `--add-ca-certificates`  with the [lifecycle](/) related commands.

### Extensions

This release includes a new mechanism to pre-generate font caches with [desktop-related extensions](/). This enables system font cache generation at install time, isolated from the potentially (ABI) incompatible host-generated cache.

To benefit from this feature, extension snaps will need to be rebuilt. More details about this feature can be found in the [specification](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/specifications/desktop-extensions-font-hook.org).

### Package repositories

The  *experimental*  [package repositories](/interfaces/package-repositories) has the following changes:

* the undocumented `$SNAPCRAFT_APT` variables have been removed.
* improved error handling and schema validation.

Additionally, the package repository [specification](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/specifications/package-repositories.org) has been finalised, hopefully opening a path to remove the _experimental_ flag for this feature.

### Updates to the Store

#### Progressive Releases

Metrics have been added to our progressive releases feature, as defined by the [specification](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/specifications/progressive-releases.org). Input on this feature is welcome on the [forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/new-topic?title=Progressive%20Releases%20Feedback&category=snapcraft).

See [Progressive releases](/) for more details.

#### Snap Revisions

Snapcraft's  `revisions`  command is now internally using a new endpoint to provide much better results:

* table headers have changed to better represent architectures
* channels are now fully qualified (i.e.;  `<track/risk/branch>` )
* comma separated column entries no longer have a space separating each item

Refer to the [specification](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/specifications/history-to-releases.org) for further details.
