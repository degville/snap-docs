# release-notes-snapcraft-3-0

These are the release notes for [Snapcraft 3.0](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.0), a major overhaul of the snap build environment. 

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](/), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](/) for other *Snapcraft* releases.

## Build environments

This release adds specific build environments for each snapcraft project you work on. These environments are tuned for each project, and ensure both API and ABI compatibility are in place for every binary built within each respective environment. 

Snapcraft's build environments leverage a snap architecture feature called [bases](/interfaces/base-snaps). At build time, the *snapcraft* tool ensures you are creating your applications inside an environment specifically tailored for the specified base.

To make the transition to Snapcraft 3.0 easy, the entire functionality for this new tool behavior is triggered by making use of the `base` keyword in `snapcraft.yaml`. 

Snapcraft 3.0 also remains backwards compatible. This means you can omit the `base` keyword and continue working as you did previously until you are ready to move to a newer or different stack provided by a different *base*.

The environment runs in a container, which means it's isolated from the user during normal operation. However, the following commands enable you to step into this encapsulated environment:

-   `--shell`: builds your snap to the [lifecycle step](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231#heading--steps) prior to that specified and opens a shell into the environment (e.g. running `snapcraft prime --shell` will run up to the `stage` step and open a shell).
-   `--shell-after`: builds your snap to the [lifecycle step](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231#heading--steps) specified and opens a shell into the environment. (eg. running `snapcraft prime --shell-after` will run up to the `prime` step and then drop into a shell).
-   `--debug`, opens a shell inside the environment after an error occur.

The below video shows an example of how the system behaves with the new functionality in place:

## macOS support

With this release of Snapcraft 3.0, we are happy to announce support for macOS via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/snapcraft). Moreover, the experience is transparent thanks to the use of build environments and its underlying technology.

See [Install snapcraft on macOS](/t/installing-snapcraft/20334#heading--macos) for further details.

<h3 id='heading--base-exceptions'>Features incompatible with bases</h3>

When using the `base` keyword in `snapcraft.yaml` the following (long deprecated) features become unavailable:

-   _wiki parts_, and their quirks in the code base, that enabled specific corner cases, such as allowing `/` in parts.
-   `snapcraft cleanbuild` and triggering builds with LXD in certain environment variables.
-   `prepare`, `build` and `install` in parts. These have been replaced by `override-build` and `snapcraftctl`. These offer `override-` for `pull`, `stage` and `prime` too.
-   The `snap` keyword has been superseded by the `prime` keyword.
-   `--disable-parallel-build` is no longer available when calling build commands through *snapcraft*. It can be setup, per part, using the `build-attributes` property.
-   `--use-geoip` is no longer available when calling build commands through *snapcraft*. This affected `stage-packages`.

 
In addition to the above, the following plugins also become unavailable when using the `base` keyword:

-   `tar-content`, superseded by the `dump` plugin.
-   `copy`, superseded by the `dump` plugin.
-   `jhbuild`, it has too many dependencies against `core`.

## New *core* features

The following are new when using `base`:

### License

A snap's license can now be defined using the new *license* keyword and a [SPDX 2.0 format](https://spdx.org/licenses/) value within *snapcraft.yaml*.

Validation of the license syntax is done using `snap pack` schema validation to ensure consistency across the snap ecosystem.

### Wrapperless-snaps

When originally introduced, *wrappers* were useful when setting up the environment appropriately. However, the runtime architecture has now evolved in such a way that wrappers no longer make sense.

Although it is not the default today, the intention is to make the `adapter` value (`full`) the default behaviour. The advantage with this design is that when entering a shell through `snap run --shell`, the environment would be properly loaded through use of `command-chain` entries in `snap.yaml`.

The recording below shows how the original `command`, defined in `snapcraft.yaml`, is still the `command`that makes it to `snap.yaml` (and the `command-chain` feature is used instead):

<h3 id='heading--extensions'>Extensions</h3>

The architecture and framework has been cemented into the `snapcraft` tool to help *snapcraft.yaml* grow declarative* functionality we're calling *Extensions*. We have done this to avoid repetitive tasks, and to avoid snap builders needing deep knowledge of a target software stack.

Extensions have the unique property of being applied to `snapcraft.yaml` itself, where they can be expanded upon and, potentially, used in lieu of the extension itself. This would allow for project-specific modifications of the extension.

You can interact with extensions using the following new commands:
-   `list-extensions`, to view the available extensions.
-   `extension`, to show information about the extension.
-   `expand-extensions`, to display how the `snapcraft.yaml` will look like with the extensions applied.

### Lifecycle cleaning

Prior to Snapcraft 3.0, you needed to manually clean any *part* that was found to be dirty due to modifications in the code itself, or because modifications had been made to the *part* definition in `snapcraft.yaml`. This become an unnecessary burden for developers.

The default action for *snapcraft* to now rebuild parts, either by re-running a lifecycle step without cleaning, for plugins that allow for it (through their underlying architecture), or automatically cleaning and re-running the necessary lifecycle steps for that part.

You can see this in action below:

[![asciicast](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4309e0614246524ff2bff73ea44170bb83bc2935/68747470733a2f2f61736369696e656d612e6f72672f612f6c33674e355179517933446771304b7a50353253644e7631712e737667)](https://asciinema.org/a/l3gN5QyQy3Dgq0KzP52SdNv1q)

### Implicit source

Previously, if a part did not specify a source, an implicit default source of `.` was set by default. This caused considerable confusion.

Starting with Snapcraft 3.0, if a plugins requires a source to be specified, it will be required through the schema and an appropriate error message will be generated.

For plugins where a source isn't a requirement, such as `nil`, no action will be taken and no default will be set.


## Plugins

With the exception of deprecated and removed plugins, the majority of plugins have been reworked to be `base` aware.


Since the declaration of the `base` keyword is done manually by the user, some plugins have introduced semantic changes for how they operate.

Below is the set of plugins with interesting changes and new properties available to the user:

### ant

      corresponding to those sources will be used.

    - go-importpath:
      (string)
      This entry tells the checked out `source` to live within a certain path
      within `GOPATH`.
      This is not needed and does not affect `go-packages`.

      within `GOPATH`. This is required in order to work with absolute imports
      and import path checking.

```

### `gradle`

These are the properties the `gradle` plugin now operates with:

```
    - gradle-options:
      (list of strings)
