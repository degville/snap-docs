<h2 id='heading--git'>Git Sources</h2>

-   sources: make submodule fetching configurable by [@mr-cal](https://github.com/mr-cal) in [#3629](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/3629)

More fine grained source fetching, three new scenarios are supported:

1.  fetching only listed submodules, in the defined `source-submodules`

```source-yaml
parts:
  git-test:
    plugin: dump
    source-type: git
    source: git@github.com...
    source-submodules:
      - submodule_1
      - dir1/submodule_2
```

1.  excluding all submodules with an empty list

```source-yaml
parts:
  git-test:
    plugin: dump
    source-type: git
    source: git@github.com...
    source-submodules: []
```

1.  not defined (the default), all submodules are fetched

<h2 id='heading--extensions'>Extensions</h2>

### KDE

-   extension: compose and dead-keys for neon by [@sergiusens](https://github.com/sergiusens) in [#3643](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/3643)
-   set lzo compression by default in kde-neon extension by [@jriddell](https://github.com/jriddell) in [#3595](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/3595)

<h2 id='heading--cli'>Command Line Interface</h2>

-   dependencies: missing library resolution by [@mr-cal](https://github.com/mr-cal) in [#3634](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/3634)
-   cli: reintroduce remote-build and promote to snapcraft help by [@aritra24](https://github.com/aritra24) in [#3648](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/3648)

Since the `/usr` merge with `/` the potentially missing stage-packages to add and solve missing dependencies was not working correctly on core20, this has now been fixed

The two command line client commands that were previously hidden, `promote` and `remote-build`, are now displayed as part of the general help.
