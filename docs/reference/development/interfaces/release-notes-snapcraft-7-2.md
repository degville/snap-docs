# release-notes-snapcraft-7-2

The team behind Snapcraft is pleased to announce the release of [Snapcraft 7.2.0](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/7.2.0), a major update to the tool used to build snap packages.

Among the many any other updates, fixes and additions, the following are what we consider its highlights:

* Automatic linting with the `core22` base
* Easy switching between LXD and Multipass build providers
* A new store authentication mechanism

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-release-notes) for other *Snapcraft* releases.

## Snapcraft linting

Snapcraft now includes its own linter functionality when working with snaps using the `core22` [base](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/base-snaps/11198). Snapcraft linters run automatically when a snap is packed, and will report any detected errors unless otherwise [disabled](/t/snapcraft-linters/32211#heading--disabled).

The following two linters are currently supported:

* **[`classic`](/)**: verifies binary file parameters for snaps using [classic confinement](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snap-confinement/6233)
* **[`library`](/)**: verifies that no ELF file dependencies, such as libraries, are missing

## Default provider switching

Linux users of Snapcraft can now switch the default provider (LXD) to Multipass. Do to so, run:

```
snap set snapcraft provider=multipass
```

To go back to LXD, run:

```
snap set snapcraft provider=lxd
```

See [Build providers](/) for more details.

## Store changes

### Validation Sets

Incorrectly formatted YAML for Validation Sets, or those not completely accepted by the store, can now be interactively edited for further iteration:

### On Prem Store

Supported commands are:

* upload
* release
* list-revisions
* close
* status
* login
* export-login
* logout
* whoami

To work with a deployed on premises store, the following must be set:

* `STORE_DASHBOARD_URL=http[s]://<store-IP>/publisher`
* `STORE_UPLOAD_URL=http[s]://<store-IP>`
* `SNAPCRAFT_STORE_AUTH=onprem`

### Credentials Format

Snapcraft 7.2 now outputs a new standard (to the tools that require it) export login. This format is usable by Ubuntu Image and snapd.

Existing exported credentials remain compatible, however these *newly* exported tokens are not backwards compatible with versions lower than Snapcraft 7.2.0

The following is the complete list of features and issues worked on for 7.2.0. See The [Snapcraft 7.2.0 GitHub release](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/7.2.0) for further details.
