# release-notes-snapcraft-3-1

These are the release notes for [Snapcraft 3.1](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.1), a minor release that builds on the foundations of [Snapcraft 3.0](/interfaces/release-notes-snapcraft-3-0).

For general details, including installation instructions, see [Snapcraft overview](/), or take a look at [Snapcraft release notes](/) for other *Snapcraft* releases.

## Build environments

When using the [base](/t/snapcraft-overview/8940#base-snap) keyword, it is once again possible to clean parts:


```bash
$ snapcraft clean <part-name>
```

Cleaning individual steps from a specific part, by adding `--step` to `clean`, is being redesigned to be more intuitive and straightforward in its use.

## New *core* features

### `before` and `after`	

`before` and `after` keywords can now be used to order service launching within a snap. 

### AppStream extractor

The [AppStream](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/) metadata extractor can now properly handle tags inside the relevant nodes and properly filter `xml:lang`.

Taking the following AppStream metadata as an example input:


```xml
  <description>
    <p>List:</p>
    <p xml:lang="es">Lista:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First item.</li>
      <li xml:lang="es">Primer item.</li>
      <li>Second item.</li>
      <li xml:lang="es">Segundo item.</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
```
...would generate the following description in `snap.yaml`:

```yaml
List:

- First item.
- Second item.

```

Additionally, desktop files are now properly found from either the AppStream `launchable` entries, or by falling back to legacy mode and inferring the desktop file from the appstream `id`.

## Plugins

### cmake

The plugin can now use `build-snaps` within the build environment. When any given `build-snaps` entry exists for a part that uses the `cmake` plugin, the plugin will make use of `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` so that libraries and headers from that snap are preferred.

Additionally, `cmake` primitives are now used to drive the build instead of just calling `make`.

These features have already been used to create an initial set of KDE applications leveraging `core18` as a base as described on the [KDE apps at the snap of your fingers](https://snapcraft.io/blog/kde-apps-at-the-snap-of-your-fingers) article.

### rust

The `rust` plugin has been refactored in a backwards compatible way to work better with the non-legacy `rustup` tool.

## Platform updates

### macOS

When using `snapcraft` with Homebrew for the first time, if `multipass` is not found, the user will be prompted to install it before proceeding.

## Full list of changes

The issues and features worked on for 3.1 can be seen on the [3.1 launchpad milestone](https://launchpad.net/snapcraft/+milestone/3.1) which are reflected in the following change list:
