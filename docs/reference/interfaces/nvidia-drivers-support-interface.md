#  nvidia-drivers-support interface

The `nvidia-drivers-support` interface is for internal Ubuntu Core use only.

This interface permits the [nvidia-assemble](https://snapcraft.io/nvidia-assemble) snap to access to NVIDIA char devices, `/dev/nvidiactl` and `/dev/nvidia-uvmfrom`, which it needs to assemble and load the NVIDIA kernel drives.
