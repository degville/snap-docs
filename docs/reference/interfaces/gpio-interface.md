`gpio` allows access to a specific GPIO pin. The interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to GPIO hardware.


Use  `snap interface gpio` to see which gpio devices are available on the system:

```bash
$ snap interface gpio
name:    gpio
summary: allows access to a specific GPIO pin
slots:
  - pi:bcm-gpio-0
  - pi:bcm-gpio-1
  - pi:bcm-gpio-10
[...]
```

The [pi-fancontrol](https://snapcraft.io/pi-fancontrol) snap provides simple fan control on a Raspberry Pi with a fan connected to GPIO 14 (pin 8). With the snap installed, the following command will connect the interface to the pin:

```bash
snap connect pi-fancontrol:gpio pi:bcm-gpio-14
```

```{tip}

See [Interface management](/) and [Supported interfaces](/interfaces/index) for further details on how interfaces are used.

**Auto-connect**: no</br>
**Attributes**:
 * `number` (slot): GPIO pin number to export and expose to consuming snaps

[Hardware IO interfaces](/interfaces/hardware-io-interfaces) covers some general considerations common to these kinds of devices.

To use a gpio device, the snap developer must add `plugs: [ gpio ]` to a snap's [snapcraft.yaml](/). The snap user can then access a specific gpio device with an [interface connection](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--manual-connections).

Unless the snap is expected to actually use a set of gpio pins that is not predefined,  it is recommended to define distinct plugs for each used gpio pin, like:

```yaml
plugs:
  activity-led:
    interface: gpio
  warning-led:
    interface: gpio
```

This has the advantage of being self-documenting and 1-1  connections like these are easier to track and setup with [auto-connections](/), if the latter is needed.

When the interface is connected, `"echo (pin number) > /sys/class/gpio/export"`  is run internally to enable access to the GPIO pin.

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via `/sys/class/gpio/gpioN` where `N` is the pin number specified by the connected slot.

Finally, when the interface is disconnected,  `"echo (pin number) > /sys/class/gpio/unexport"`  is run internally to disable access to the GPIO pin.
