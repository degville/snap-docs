#  userns interface

The `userns` interface permits a snap to create new user [namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html). This is a system-level interface, and is not designed to be used with higher level snap applications.


## Developer details

**[Auto-connect](/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](/)**: yes

This interface  supports the inclusion of the appropriate AppArmor and seccomp policies to allow user namespaces to be created when this interface is plugged.
