#  pwm-control interface

`pwm-control` permits control over any aspect of all PWM channels.

This interface is currently **under development** and has not yet been released for general use. See [
interfaces: add pwm-control interface
](https://github.com/canonical/snapd/pull/12347) for further details on this work.

The `pwm-control` interface can potentially impact the system and other snaps, and allows privileged access to hardware. See [The pwm interface](/interfaces/pwm-interface) to access a specific channel.

**[Auto-connect](/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](/t/the-interface-connection-mechanism/20179#heading--super)**: yes
