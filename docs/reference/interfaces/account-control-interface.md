# The account-control interface

`account-control` allows managing non-system user accounts on [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs) systems.

This interface enables the management of the `extrausers` table in the Name Service Switch (NSS) databases on Ubuntu Core to manage both non-system unprivileged and privileged users and groups.

The interface **does not** allow the management of users and groups for the system NSS databases in */etc*.

Due to the privileged nature of access enabled by this interface, its use is reserved exclusively for "management snaps" from [brand stores](/t/glossary/14612#heading--brand-store).
