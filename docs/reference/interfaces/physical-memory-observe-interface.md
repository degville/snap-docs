# The physical-memory-observe interface

`physical-memory-observe ` allows read access the to physical address space via the /dev/mem device.

When the kernel is compiled with STRICT_DEVMEM=y (required for certified kernels), accessible memory is an architecture-specific subset for common use cases, such as (eg, X without KMS, DOSBox, etc).

This interface can write to all physical memory when the kernel is compiled with STRICT_DEVMEM=n.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version _2.21+_.
