# The opengl interface

`opengl` allows access to the OpenGL stack and, consequently, OpenGL hardware, which may be needed for certain types of graphical applications and those that use [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) libraries for computation. See [Adding OpenGL/GPU support to a snap](/interfaces/gpu-support) for more information on how to use this interface.
