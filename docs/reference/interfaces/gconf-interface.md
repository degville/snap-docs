#  gconf interface

The `gconf`  interface  allows access to any item from the legacy [GConf configuration system](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gconf) for the current user, typically used by old GNOME desktop libraries and applications.

This interface needs to be manually connected because _gconf_ is a global database for GNOME desktop and application settings and offers no application isolation.


## Developer details

**Auto-connect**: no

Modern applications should use dconf/gsettings instead and this interface is provided for old codebases that cannot be migrated.

### Code examples

The test code can be found in the snapd repository: https://github.com/canonical/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/gconf_test.go
