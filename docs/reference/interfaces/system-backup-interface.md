# The system-backup interface

`system-backup` provides read-only access to the system via `/var/lib/snapd/hostfs`. This interface gives privileged access to system data.

**Auto-connect**: no
**Transitional**: no

Requires snapd version _2.43+_.

By design, snaps using `strict` and `devmode` [confinement](/) run with a different root filesystem than the host. Snaps that implement a backup function, however, need access to the host's snap-related files outside of this confinement, and this is where the `system-backup` interface can help.

The system-backup interface provides read-only access to files under the following location:

- `/var/lib/snapd/hostfs`

With the following exceptions:
- `/var/lib/snapd/hostfs/dev`
- `/var/lib/snapd/hostfs/proc`
- `/var/lib/snapd/hostfs/sys`

Importantly, neither snapd nor this interface provide any mechanisms to ensure the system is in a ready state for backups. Reliable backup strategies with snaps utilising this interface will need to account for this themselves.
