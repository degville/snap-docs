#  system-packages-doc interface

The `system-packages-doc` interface permits access file system locations used to store system documentation. These include the following

* `/usr/{,local/}share/doc/`
* `/usr/share/cups/doc-root/`
* `/usr/share/gimp/2.0/help/`
* `/usr/share/gtk-doc/`
* `/usr/share/javascript/`
* `/usr/share/libreoffice/help/`
* `/usr/share/sphinx_rtd_theme/`
* `/usr/share/xubuntu-docs/	`

After the interface has been connected, the host’s `/usr/share/doc` directory replaces the `/usr/share/doc` for the context of the snap.

This interface is helpful for *web browsers*, for example, because it enables them to open and view the host’s HTML system documentation.
