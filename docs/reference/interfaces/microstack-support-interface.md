#  microstack-support interface

The `microstack-support` interface enables multiple service access for the _Microstack infrastructure_. It's used by the [Microstack](https://microstack.run/) snap, a full OpenStack deployment within a single snap package.
 
Virtual machines are spawned as QEMU processes with libvirt acting as a management daemon (including for activities such as applying AppArmor profiles).

Networking is provided largely via OpenVSwitch and Neutron, with dnsmasq acting as an auxiliary daemon. A tun/tap kernel module is used for creating virtual interfaces.

Virtual machines rely on KVM for virtualisation acceleration and the vhost framework in the kernel (vhost_net, vhost_scsi, vhost_vsock).


## Developer details

**[Auto-connect](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--auto-connections)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](/)**: yes</br>

This interface allows MicroStack to operate by allowing the necessary system calls to be used by the following services:
- libvirt
- qemu
- qemu-img
- Nova
- Neutron
- Keystone
- Glance
- Cinder
