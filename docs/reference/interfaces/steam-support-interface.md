#  steam-support interface

The `steam-support` interface has been developed specifically to help Valve's Steam client configure [pressure-vessel](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/tree/master/pressure-vessel) containers from the [Steam snap](https://snapcraft.io/steam).

Only the Steam snap may establish this interface. See [Introducing early access to the Steam snap](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-early-access-to-the-steam-snap/28082) for more details.
