#  nvme-control interface 

The `nvme-control` interface allows snaps to manage and access NVMe controllers,alongside namespaces via in-kernel NVMe interfaces (PCI & NVMe-oF).

This interface provides access to enumerate devices, create/delete/attach/detach namespaces, and read device health/ telemetry data.

Access is limited to NVMe management operations through sysfs, nvme-fabrics char device, and controller/namespace device nodes. Raw block I/O remains constrained by device cgroups. The nvme and nvme-tcp kernel modules may auto-load as needed.

For further details on interfaces, see [How to connect interfaces](/how-to-guides/work-with-snaps/connect-interfaces).
