#  raw-usb interface

`raw-usb`  allows access to all connected USB devices via a raw interface.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version _2.18+_.

**NOTE:** The use of this interface only extends the snapd's own sandbox confinement, it will NOT supersede the classic Unix file permission model so the user still needs to have sufficient `r` or `w` permission to the device node by either run the snap command as root or have a designated udev rule that grants the permission.
