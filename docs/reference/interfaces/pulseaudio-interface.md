#  pulseaudio interface

> :warning:  As of snapd 2.41, this interface is deprecated and the [`audio-playback`](/reference/interfaces/audio-playback-interface) and [`audio-record`](/reference/interfaces/audio-record-interface) interfaces should be used instead. They provide access to PulseAudio and will provide access to other sound servers in the future.

`pulseaudio` enables access to the PulseAudio sound server for sound playback and recording. 

**Auto-connect**: no

*Note: The [`audio-playback`](/reference/interfaces/audio-playback-interface) interface is auto-connected.*
