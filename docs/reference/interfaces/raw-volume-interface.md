# The raw-volume interface

`raw-volume` provides access to a specific disk partition. This interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to device partitions.

The slot is intended to be implemented by a gadget snap and is not provided by the core system snap.

**Auto-Connect**: no
**Attributes**:
 * `path` (slot): path to device partition e.g. `/dev/mmcblk0p1`

Requires snapd version *2.43+*.

To use a disk partition, the snap developer must add `plugs: [ raw-volume ]` to a snap's [snapcraft.yaml](/). The snap user can then access a specific disk partition with an [interface connection](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--manual-connections).

Use  `snap interface raw-volume` to see which disk partitions are available on the system for snaps to use:

```bash
$ snap interface raw-volume
name:    raw-volume
summary: allows access to specific disk partition
slots:
  - foo:mmcblk0p1
  - foo:mmcblk0p2
```

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via the path specified by the connected slot.
