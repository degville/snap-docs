# Tutorials

This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what snap is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing your favourite applications, taking a data snapshot, removing snaps or reinstalling the snap daemon (snapd).

## Get started

Snap is installed by default on Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions. Our _Features tour_ is an ideal way to get started.

## Installation 

Installation instructions for those distributions that don't include _snap_ by default, and for users who may have previously removed snap from distributions that do.

* [Installing snapd](install-the-daemon/index): Installation instructions for all popular Linux distributions

### Snap pre-installed

The snap daemon (snapd) is pre-installed and ready to go on the following:

| [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) | [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) |
[Solus](https://getsol.us/) | [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 18.04 and above |
 | Most [Ubuntu flavours](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives#Official_Ubuntu_Flavors) | [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/) |


### Without snap
