# How snaps work

Understand how snaps update automatically, and use revisions and transactional updates to mange risk and mitigate potential issues.

* [Refresh awareness](/explanation/how-snaps-work/refresh-awareness): How updates are handled when apps are running.
* [Using channels](/explanation/how-snaps-work/channels-and-tracks): Understanding channels, tracks, risk-levels and branches.
* [Revisions](/explanation/how-snaps-work/revisions): The unique identity for each and every snap version.
* [Transactional updates](/explanation/how-snaps-work/transactional-updates): Update a group of snaps together, or none at all. 
* [Snap performance](/explanation/how-snaps-work/snap-performance): How snaps limit any performance overhead.
