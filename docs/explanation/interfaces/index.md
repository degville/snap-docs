# Interfaces

* [All about interfaces](/explanation/interfaces/all-about-interfaces): The permission system used to manage access to resources.
* [Interface auto-connection](/explanation/interfaces/interface-auto-connection): How snaps gain automatic access to resources.
* [Interface hooks](/explanation/interfaces/interface-hooks): A feature to help developers control what happens when an interface is used.
