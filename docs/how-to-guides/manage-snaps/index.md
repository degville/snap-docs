# Manage snaps

Outside of whatever facilities a snapped application may provide, additional snap functionality includes  data snapshots, usage quotas and control over if when when a service runs.

- [Connect interfaces](connect-interfaces): Control exactly what a snap can access, and what it can’t.
- [Configure snaps](configure-snaps): Learn how to set options for your servers and daemons.
- [Apps and aliases](apps-and-aliases): Use your preferred names for your snapped applications.
- [Fix common issues](fix-common-issues): If you do run into problems, find common solutions here.
- [Manage updates](manage-updates): Control when snaps update, or hold an update indefinitely .
- [Create data snapshots](create-data-snapshots): Make a copy of a snap’s user, system and configuration data.
- [Use quota resources](use-resource-quotas): Set processor and memory resource limits on your snaps.
- [Disk space awareness](disk-space-awareness): Check whether there’s enough disk space before certain operations.
- [Set system options](set-system-options): The main way to configure your snapped applications.
- [Control services](control-services): Start, stop and restart snapped background service.
- [Validation sets](manage-validation-sets): Ensure a defined set of snaps are installed and updated together.
