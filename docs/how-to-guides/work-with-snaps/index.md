# Work with snaps

The snap system has been designed to look after itself with automatic security and update policies. However, these elements, and many others, can also be configured and managed manually.

- [Manage updates](manage-updates): Control when snaps update, or hold an update indefinitely .
- [Connect interfaces](connect-interfaces): Control exactly what a snap can access, and what it canâ€™t.
- [Configure snaps](configure-snaps): Learn how to set options for your servers and daemons.
- [Apps and aliases](apps-and-aliases): Use your preferred names for your snapped applications.
